Welcome to Java Mini Python's documentation!
============================================

.. centered::  Version |version| released |today|

Java Mini Python provides an implementation of a useful subset of
Python syntax in Java.  The sweet spot is where you need a `DSL
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language>`__ (eg
expressions, variables, conditionals, methods/macros, callbacks) and
would like to use Python's syntax.

It was originally written in order to have a richer configuration file
on Android. For example you could make the brightness setting have a
value of 7 except on Thursday afternoons, unless the program has been
running for 24 hours.

If you are looking for a fuller implementation of Python then try the
`Jython Project <http://www.jython.org/>`__
